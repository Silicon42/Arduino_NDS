# Arduino_NDS
Arduino interface to Nintento NDS -- read and controls all NDS buttons from Arduino program.

This project uses an Arduini mini Pro board wich is connected to all the puttons of a Nintendo Duak Screen (phat). 
The Arduino sketch can then be used to control the NDS with a simple microcode program stored in the Arduino's memory.
